SECTION 137.1: POKER TEST FOR RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM CATEGORIZES FIXED-SIZE GROUPS OF RANDOM NUMBERS
BASED ON HOW MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF NUMBER ARE IN EACH
GROUP. A TYPE IS DETERMINED BY WHICH FRACTION OF THE 0 - 1
SEGMENT THE VALUE OF THE NUMBER FALLS WITHIN. CHI-SQUARE
IS THEN COMPUTED AND DISPLAYED AS THE RESULT TO SEE IF
IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH THE EXPECTED DISTRIBUTION FOR UNIFORM
RANDOM NUMBERS.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                    BEGIN TEST

RUNNING  12005  TRIALS, SO THAT EACH POSSIBILITY HAS
EXPECTED VALUE >= 5, AS NEEDED FOR CHI-SQUARE TEST.

#TYPES          ACTUAL COUNT    EXPECTED COUNT
 1               5               5 
 2               421             450 
 3               3733            3750 
 4               6030            6000 
 5               1816            1800 

FOR FOUR D.F., SHOULD HAVE .710721 <= CHI-SQ <= 9.48773
(5% TAIL AT EACH END.)

ACTUAL CHI-SQ =  2.2381778 

*** INFORMATIVE TEST PASSED ***

                   END TEST
