PROGRAM FILE 41: ACCURACY OF MULTIPLICATION
    ANSI STANDARD 7.2, 7.4, 7.6

*** NOTE: THIS PROGRAM MAKES USE OF 'READ' AND 'DATA'
    WHICH HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED. IF SUBSEQUENT TESTS SHOW
    THESE FEATURES TO BE INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED, THEN THE
    VALIDITY OF THE RESULTS OF THIS TEST ROUTINE IS DOUBTFUL.

SECTION 41.1 ACCURACY OF MULTIPLICATION.

THIS SECTION TESTS THE ACCURACY OF MULTIPLICATION. THE 
COMPUTED RESULT IS COMPARED WITH A RANGE ESTABLISHED BY
PERTURBING EACH OPERAND BY 1 IN ITS 6TH DIGIT. THE RESULT
PASSES IF IT FALLS WITHIN THE EXTREME VALUES GENERATED BY
THIS PERTURBATION (ACCURATE TO SIX DIGITS).

THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY, SINCE THE ANSI STANDARD
DOES NOT MANDATE ANY ACCURACY FOR NUMERIC EXPRESSIONS.
