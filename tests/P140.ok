    ANSI STANDARD 8.4

SECTION 140.1: RUNS TEST FOR THE RND FUNCTION.

THIS PROGRAM COUNTS HOW MANY RUNS OF A GIVEN LENGTH OCCUR
WITHIN A SERIES OF RANDOM NUMBERS. A RUN IS A SUBSEQUENCE
OF THE NUMBERS WITHIN WHICH THE VALUES ARE IN ASCENDING
ORDER. THE RESULTS ARE COMPARED WITH THE EXPECTED OUTCOME
FOR UNIFORM RANDOM NUMBERS, AND CHI-SQUARE IS COMPUTED
AND DISPLAYED. ALL RUNS OF LENGTH >= 6 ARE CONSOLIDATED
INT ONE CATEGORY.

***** THIS TEST IS INFORMATIVE ONLY *****

                  BEGIN TEST

FOR 6 D.F., SHOULD HAVE 1.63539 <= CHI-SQ <= 12.5916
(5% TAIL ON EACH END.)

ACTUAL CHI-SQ =  9.3886586
